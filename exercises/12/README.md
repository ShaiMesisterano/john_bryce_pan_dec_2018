<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a function named <code>calcAverage</code> which reads a set of grades with values from 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Values outside that range will be ignored.</p>
<p>The function will return the average value of all values that were between 1 and 5.</p>
<p>If all values were ignored (or no grades were sent to the function) a zero is returned</p></li>
<li>
<p>Create Jest tests for <code>calcAverage</code>.</p>
<p>The parameter for the function should be an array of numbers, such as <code>[1, 5, 3, 88, 2, 0]</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
